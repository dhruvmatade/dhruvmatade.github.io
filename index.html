<h2>About</h2>
<p>I am a PhD Scholar at Dublin City University specializing in Finance and Family Business research. My work examines the definitions of family firms and their evolution across different economic and institutional contexts. I study how family ownership structures influence decision-making and the long-term development of these firms.</p>
<p>My research also explores the role of institutional quality, governance practices, and socio-economic factors in shaping the strategies and growth of family businesses, particularly in emerging markets.</p>
<p>Beyond academia, I maintain interests in chess, cricket, geopolitics, and cinema, which provide diverse perspectives that enrich my analytical approach to business and finance research.</p>
